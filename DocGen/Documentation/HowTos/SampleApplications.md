# Example applications

This project ships with several sample applications. These are working apps demonstrating World Locking Tools' capabilities, and scenarios which World Locking Tools enables.

They also attempt to show best practices in coding against the World Locking Tools APIs.

Supplementary samples can be found in the [World Locking Tools Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedReality-WorldLockingTools-Samples) sibling repository, which has its own [documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedReality-WorldLockingTools-Samples/README.html). That repo contains more projects illustrating the use of World Locking Tools in both minimal settings, and in more advanced usage. In particular, more advanced samples are free to incorporate external libraries, which would be inappropriate to include in the base configuration here, to show how World Locking Tools working in cooperation with other technologies can produce results beyond what either can achieve alone.
