    /// Component helper for pinning the world locked space at a single reference point.

    /// <remarks>
    /// This component captures the initial pose of its gameObject, and then a second pose. It then
    /// adds that pair to the WorldLocking Alignment Manager. The manager then negotiates between all
    /// such added pins, based on the current head pose, to generate a frame-to-frame mapping aligning
    /// the Frozen Space, i.e. Unity's Global Space, such that the pins match up as well as possible.
    /// Another way to phrase this is:
    ///    Given an arbitrary pose (the "modeling pose"),
    ///    and a pose aligned somehow to the real world (the "world locked pose"),
    ///    apply a correction to the camera such that a virtual object with coordinates of the modeling pose
    ///    will appear overlaid on the real world at the position and orientation described by the locked pose.
    /// For this component, the locked pose must come in via one of the following three APIs:
    ///     <see cref="SetFrozenPose(Pose)"/> with input pose in Frozen Space, which includes pinning.
    ///     <see cref="SetSpongyPose(Pose)"/> with input pose in Spongy Space, which is the space of the camera's parent,
    ///         and is the same space the camera moves in, and that native APIs return values in (e.g. XR).
    ///     <see cref="SetLockedPose(Pose)"/> with input pose in Locked Space, which is the space stabilized by
    ///         the Frozen World engine DLL but excluding pinning.
    /// Note that since the Frozen Space is shifted by the AlignmentManager, calling SetFrozenPose(p) with the same Pose p
    /// twice is probably an error, since the Pose p would refer to different a location after the first call.
